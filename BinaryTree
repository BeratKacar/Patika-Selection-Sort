pick 9 --> 9 > 7 so we will look at the right branches of the tree --> 8 < 9 so 9 will be located to the left side of 8
pick 4 --> 4 < 7 so we will look at the left branches of the tree --> 5 > 4 so we will look at the left branches of the 5 --> 1 < 4 so we will look at the right branches of the 1 --> 3 < 4 so 4 will be located to the right side of 3
pick 2 --> 2 < 7 so we will look at the left branches of the tree --> 5 > 2 so we will look at the left branches of the 5 --> 1 < 2 so we will look at the right branches of the 1 --> 3 > 2 so 2 will be located to the left side of 3
