[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort

split in the half --> [16,21,11]  -  [8,12,22]
split in the half again --> [16] - [21,11] - [8] - [12,22]
one more --> [16] - [21] - [11] - [8] - [12] - [22]
start the merge sorting --> pick 16 and swap 11 --> pick 21 and swap 16 --> result: [11,16,21] - [8] - [12] - [22]
8 ,12, 22 already in order --> [11,16,21] - [8,12,22]
pick 8 and swap 11 --> pick 11 swap 16 --> pick 12 swap 21 --> result: [8,11,12,16,21,22]
